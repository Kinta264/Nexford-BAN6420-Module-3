## **Usage**

You are recommended to open the python files first.
The assignment has requested to split the python file into 3 separate files for the 3 different classes of policy holder, policy product and payment.
File Module 3 Kp1 deals with the policy holder.
File Module 3 Kp2 deals with the policy product.
File Module 3 Kp3 deals with the payment.
Each file is handling the requested tasks for each class.
You can run the code at each step to see the progression of the answer to assignment.
Upon completion of python code review, you can open the R file.

In the R file, you can see the summary of the python code in the previous files.
The policy management commands can be found at the end of the file.
